                        "I am just an ordinary woman with ordinary concerns," says India's favourite daughter Aishwarya Rai. But in reality "Aishu", as she is known, has become much more than an ordinary woman. Indeed many would argue she's also more than an ordinary star, because international fame has made her an unofficial ambassador for her home country's burgeoning film industry.
