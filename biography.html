            <p class="bio-p">Aishwarya Bachchan Rai, Aishwarya Rai, (born November 1, 1973, Mangalore, Karnataka state, India), Indian actress whose classic beauty made her one of Bollywood’s premier stars.Rai was raised in a traditional South Indian home and was pursuing an education in architecture when she was crowned Miss World in 1994. The title put her on the fast track of the modeling business. She landed lucrative jobs with PepsiCo, Inc., and Vogue magazine, and in 2003 she signed on as a spokesmodel for L’Oréal Paris. Her acting career began in earnest with acclaimed performances in Iruvar (1997; The Duo) and …Aur pyaar ho gaya (1997; based on the 1994 American movie Only You). Both films broke from the simplistic structure typical of Bollywood films at the time and helped to push Rai to the forefront of the “New Bollywood.” For decades the Indian film industry had produced a large number of very predictable and clichéd feature films that were enjoyed almost exclusively by South Asians. Changes in Bollywood with regard to financing and production, however, had seen the industry move to improve the artistic quality of its product and to expand its audience beyond South Asia.</p>
             
            <h2>Personal Life</h2>
             <p class="bio-p">In 1999, Rai began dating Bollywood actor Salman Khan; their relationship was often reported in the media until the couple separated in 2002. Rai cited "abuse (verbal, physical and emotional), infidelity and indignity" on the part of Khan as reasons for ending the relationship.[152][153] She then had a romantic relationship with actor Vivek Oberoi before they broke-up in 2005.[154]

                Though they both appeared in Dhai Akshar Prem Ke (in which her then longtime boyfriend, Salman Khan, had a brief cameo) and Kuch Naa Kaho, Abhishek Bachchan fell in love with Rai whilst filming Dhoom 2.Their engagement was announced on 14 January 2007 and later confirmed by his father, Amitabh Bachchan.The couple married on 20 April 2007 according to traditional Hindu rites of the Bunt community, to which she belongs. North Indian and Bengali ceremonies were also performed. The wedding took place in a private ceremony at the Bachchan residence, "Prateeksha", in Juhu, Mumbai. They have been described in the Indian media as a supercouple. Rai is very close to her family, and lived with them in Bandra, Mumbai, until her marriage.
                
                Rai is Hindu and deeply religious.Her international presence shot up when Abhishek Bachchan accompanied her to the Cannes Film Festival shortly after their marriage, and later to The Oprah Winfrey Show, appearing on 28 September 2009. They were described as being more famous as a couple than Brangelina.
                
                Rai gave birth to a girl, Aaradhya, on 16 November 2011. Rai is commonly referred to by fans and the media by the nicknames "Ash" and "Aish", but has stated that she dislikes being called as such. She has discouraged people from referring to her by names other than "Aishwarya" as she does not want to "spoil [her] good name".</p>
                <h2>Social and humanitarian work</h2>
                <div class="bio-p">
                    In 1999 Rai participated in a world tour called the Magnificent Five, along with Aamir Khan, Rani Mukerji, Akshaye Khanna and Twinkle Khanna. In the same year, she was appointed as Longines Ambassador of Elegance. In 2003, she became the first Indian actress to be a jury member at the Cannes Film Festival. In the same year she became a global brand ambassador of L'Oréal, alongside Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Penélope Cruz. Rai is the brand ambassador for The Eye Bank Association of India's nationwide campaign to promote eye donation in India. In 2005, she became a brand ambassador for Pulse Polio, a campaign established by the Government of India in 1994 to eradicate polio in India. In the same year, Rai was appointed spokesperson for the International Year of Microcredit, raising awareness of the main goals and priorities of the United Nations' poverty alleviation efforts.
